Oh man! Look at that girl, right there!
Goodness gracious! That girl fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine! She know she fine too!
She is banging!
She's off the hook!
She looks good, you're right
Hey, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl
Chris, I can get her
You can't get that girl, Mike
I guarantee you can't get that girl!
Watch me get that girl
I bet you never-Neverland, you can't
I can get her
All right! Shomon, then, Shomon!
Watch

I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild, I like that

My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain these things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need (oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh)

It feels so right (girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life (all my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels like I (like I)
Have finally found her perfect love is mine (see)
And I finally found, come on, girl

You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give (you rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (you rocked my world)
You rocked my world, you know you did (girl)
And everything I own I give (come on, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do (oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh)

Who'd think that I (oh)
Finally found the perfect love
I searched for all my life? (Searched for all my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find (whoa oh oh)
